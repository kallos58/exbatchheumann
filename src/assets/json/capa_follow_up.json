These filters are not of BIBO design, as in other parts of the HVAC system. The surface contamination of these filters (by powders from manufacturing) is not considered for the design (BIBO) or replacement (risk based, possibly upon product change). Due to the reversed pressure cascade in the manufacturing areas, any malfunction of the HVAC could lead to a push-back of collected contaminants on the filter-surface to the manufacturing room. This could also include powders from other products and therefore be the cause for cross-contamination with HAPIs.",
      "CAPA_Repsonse": "2024-02-29 (Rev.00): The filters are installed specifically to protect the HVAC extraction ducts and prevent crosscontaminations stemming from backflow from the ductwork as a result of extraction ventilation failure. The HVAC systems to the clean rooms consist of AHU, that supply the air to the rooms, ensuring correct environmental conditions and air exchange rates, and extraction ventilation that extracts the contaminated air from the rooms and controls the differential pressures. The AHU and extraction ventilator are interlocked, i.e., if one stops the other also halts immediately, to prevent reversal of the pressure cascades. Furthermore, it is important to note that, in the event of extraction ventilation failure the pressure in the room towards the outside would increase, thus preventing backflow from the extraction ducting. In addition, the filters, when new, have a pressure drop of at least 125 Pa. That resistance to airflow would need to be surpassed to have backflow of air in the event of malfunction of the HVAC that would reverse the pressure cascade.\n2024-03-05 (Rev.01): Additional clarification - The HVAC system was designed by a subcontracted engineering firm, taking into consideration the design considerations suggested in the ISPE HVAC Good Practice Guide for oral solid dosage potent compounds facilities. The cross- contamination risk was assessed as a functional risk assessment carried out in May 2019 by a subcontracted consultant during the design stage of the facilities project. The project was subsequently vetted by a second engineering firm. The mentioned interlocking between AHU and extraction ventilation, 100% once- through air concept, together with the presence of double filtration at the air exhaust (at the rooms and before the extraction ventilator through HEPA BIBO), was deemed effective to control the backflow risk and, consequently, the cross- contamination risk. In our opinion, the swab sampling of the filter's surfaces would not be conclusive. The filters are porous, and therefore, the recovery through swabbing would be very difficult to determine, as the powder is captured within the filter media. In addition, the delicate filter media of the HEPA filters would be damaged by the swab process, namely the solvent.\n2024-07-19 (Rev.02): The response to this observation has been under discussion between Bluepharma and the audit team. In this scope, the risk assessment report \"1381\n— Functional Risk Assessment\" was shared with the auditors on 08/04/2024 (in attachment). Following the auditors' comments received on 08/05/2024, Bluepharma shared the following information.\n- The shared functional risk assessment was prepared during the facilities project stage to assess the compliance of the design with regulatory requirements, namely with regard to contamination and cross- contamination. I am currently preparing the risk assessment based on FMEA methodology, that abides with ICH Q9 and Bluepharma's risk management procedures. The risk assessment is almost complete, and I expect its approval until the 17\" of this month.\n- The HEPA H13 filters are optional for the supply air diffusors at the rooms ceiling, not on the extraction ducting. The functional risk assessment states that in the supply air the HEPA filters are installed at the AHU, whereas the installation of two banks of HEPA filters in series is defmed for the air extraction to prevent the possibility of backflow from contaminated extraction ducts and provide additional protection should the first filter fail.\n- The AHU/ extraction ventilator (VE) interlock was tested during the qualification. Notwithstanding, I believe that Dr. Vollcmar concerns were related with the brief moments following the AHU/ VE stoppage. As previously discussed, and requested, I am preparing a study protocol to demonstrate the absence of backflow and/or powder release from the extraction grilles HEPA H13 filters following AHU or VE failure/ stoppage. I expect the study to be concluded until the end of July, to account for rooms availability and analytical testing. On 01/07/2024, Bluepharma shared the \"HVAC System Contamination Risk Assessment Report\" with the auditors and confirmed that, as mentioned, the study is planned to be concluded until the end of July 2024 (to demonstrate the absence of backflow and/or powder release from the extraction grilles HEPA H13 filters following AHU or VE failure/ stoppage).",

      "CAPA_Repsonse": "2024-02-29 (Rev.00): The product portfolio for the new manufacturing site is still incipient. The technical transfers of the different drug products have been gradual. As explained, during the manufacturing facilities conceptual stage, a set of possible products was considered and the OEL, as well as the manufacturing steps and the forecasted % of API, were used as a basis to define the containment performance targets required for each equipment. With regard to the isolators, the minimum OEL was set at 0.5 µg/m3. ICH Q9 outlines a quality risk management process that is iterative and consists of the identification of the hazards and the analysis and evaluation of risks associated with exposure to those hazards, as well as control strategies to manage the risks. The risk is, thus, a function of hazard and exposure. The hazard is determined by the potency and toxicity of the drug substance tobe handled. Therefore, it is a fixed value throughout the manufacturing process chain. Several product-related exposure limits can be found in the literature to determine the hazard level. The most common include OEL (Occupational Exposure Limit) and ADE (Acceptable Daily Exposure). It is common for pharmaceutical organizations to use a control banding approach to categorize compounds into categories of increasing severity based on their inherent pharmacological and toxicological properties. Control banding is then used as an assessment method that relates engineering and containment measures together with health hazards and identifies a \"band\" or range of concentrations. This performance-based exposure bands categorization systems cover solely the toxicity of the pure substance, but, as abovementioned, the identification of a compound as a hazardous drug should not automatically lead to strict control solutions, because it addresses only the hazard. It does not cover the material and process factors affecting exposure (% API in the formulation, dustiness, etc.), thus, not allowing for a proper assessment of the risk. The industrial hygiene and quality perspectives also differ. Although criteria are derived from the same toxicological or clinical data, the way in which these data are used to derive acceptable limits and adequate control strategies will differ. The key differences relate to the application and interpretation of target population, routes of exposure, and acceptability criteria. Whereas for the industrial hygiene, in the context of operator protection (not patient), the principal route of exposure to the hazard is considered to be through inhalation (OEL), for product quality the primary exposure mechanisms are mix- ups, retention, mechanical\nand airbome transfer, where the ADE is the basis for risk assessment. All active drug substances are characterized with PDE as per their toxicity. The OEL will also be included in the list.

Unless otherwise justified, at least one batch per year of product manufactured in every strength and every primary packaging type, if relevant, should be included in the stability program (unless none are produced during that year).\"\nStability study are performed by Klocke. If required, results of the study can be made available. No further measures are necessary.\nAddendum:\nIt Is still the opinion of the responsible QP that the manufacturer SKC acts according to the EU GMP guideline as\n6.26 is just a general statement that it should be the \"marketed\" pack and not any other pack such as a pack from development. and 6.32 gives more details Also, from a technical point of view, it is highly improbable that there is any influence or interference from secondary packaging to the primary packed product. Besides, according to the dossier for Rivastigmine patch section 3.2.P.8.2 for ongoing stability, the parameters which should be checked at each sampling period are not related to the secondary packaging quality i.e., the variable data (such as the expiry date, batch no. serialization code) or the \"stability\" of the tamper evident seal. As supportive information, please be aware that the German local authority \"Ministerium fur Arbeit, Soziales, Frauen und Gesundheit des Saarlandes (MASFG)\" inspected SKC's manufacturing site in Korea in 2011, 2014, 2016, 2019, and 2022. According to their inspection reports which are available in copy to the Qualified Person, it was staled that QC department of SKC was inspected including the stability chambers every time, with no finding regarding the storage of stability samples.\nRegarding TE appropriateness, please be informed that Klocke conducted a stability study to check the TE\nfeasibility under 40\"Cn5%. The study was conducted for 6 months with monthly checks. All results were according to the specification. A copy of the report is available to the QP.\nHowever, after consultation of SKC, if it is the wish of Heumann to have their ongoing stability in the secondary packaging, this would be possible, but Heumann should contact SKC directly for this purpose. Perhaps the issuance of a risk assessment for continuing with the established procedure by SKC could also be a way to\nresolve. However, this should also be communicated directly between the MAH and SKC.\nThe PHAST QP considers his responsibility regarding qualification of SKC as a manufacturer to be fulfilled and deemed that this has been done correctly.",

The climate delegate consists of specially trained employees who have been explicitly appointed for this activity.\nFor proper monitoring, SOP 1-P-QM-SOP-9125172 \"Emergency plan for climate and storage facilities at Eurofins PHAST GmbH\" defines alarm limits and intervention limits. In the event of an alarm, the climate delegate is automatically informed by the measured value acquisition system. The climate delegate immediately checks the cause, evaluates the alarm and initiates measures if necessary.\nThe alarm is issued in 2 stages. At alarm level 1, the climate delegate checks the affected storage facility and decides on possible measures. If no abnormalities are detected, the storage facility continues to be monitored and the climate delegate acknowledges the alarm in the data acquisition system. If alarm level 2 is reached, this is additionally documented in the logbook of the measured value acquisition system with a rating of critical or non-critical. If it can be seen that the alarm is not due to daily use (door openings), the data for the last 1 - 2 months is looked al. If a trend is recognizable, the relocation of the test samples is triggered via a change control procedure and further measures such as defrosting are initiated.\nIf the device no longer achieves the specified conditions, an incident has occurred.

Further to this there is no complete information of BOM, comparison of validated parameter nor comparison of FPS details i.e. HPB and JAP in\nCCP, hence it was missed out for execution of validation proposal.\nAs a part of Corrective and Preventive action, Process Validation has been performed in\nsimilar code i.e. ILW (Manufacturing Process and Finished Product Specification are\nsimilar to JAP code) for killian make compression machine, based on the\nrecommendation BMR of JAP code shall be revised.\nFurther, based on availability of Export Production Order (EPO) verification batch shall\nbe taken for JAP code in Fette make compression machine.",

However\nrationale behind the frequency is not documented and same is not supported by Quality\nRisk Assessment to evaluate the periodic frequency for duct cleaning.\nCleaning of duct is initiated in year 2022 and based on new procedure we have planned\nto perform the duct cleaning. As the air movement is unidirectional the possibility of\nreturn of any stuck material is negated. If there is stuck of material and duct is blocked,\nthis may impact the CFM of the machine which can easily be identified.\nAs a part of Corrective and Preventive Action, Quality Risk Assessment shall be\nperformed to evaluate potential risks associated with existing frequency for duct\ncleaning. Based on risk assessment outcome and gained knowledge during assessment\nfrequency shall be finalized.

Also a check of the blister pile and\nof the ejection bin of the secondary packaging\nequipment after the end of the set-up process was\ndiscussed and observed.\nlt was found that the blisters are filled almost manually\nby one person. This activity can become quite\nmonotonous over a longer period of time. There is a\nrisk of incorrect filling. The downstream security\nmeasures are scales. The blisters and cartons are filled\nby weighing.

The investigation has been carried out as per SOP CQA-057 titled as “Procedure for Investigation of Out of Specification (OOS)”.\nDiscussion on Teriflunomide Tablets 14mg OOS investigation OOS/N/ST/22/003\nBased on comprehensive investigation (i.e. Preliminary investigation, analyst interrogation, and Hypothesis analysis), the root cause for the OOS results was identified as analytical error due to sonication temperature of the water bath not being maintained between 5-10°C during initial analysis by analyst and same was confirmed through hypothesis analysis.\nFurther, detailed investigation has been carried out to identify the true root cause for why sonication temperature of the water bath not being maintained between 5-10°C and it is identified that the order of sample preparation is not described properly i.e. instruction for sonication activity not arranged in proper order in test data sheet.\nThe sonication procedure for the sample preparation was described on page no. 44 of 69 and the “Note” for maintaining the temperature of water batch between 5-10°C during sonication was mentioned on next page (i.e. 45 of 69) due to chaotic procedure in test data sheet analyst oversight the “note” and overlooked the procedure of maintaining the temperature of water bath between 5- 10°C during sonication which resulted OOS results. (see table in CAPA Plan)\nAs per stepwise review, it is concluded that the Root cause for the OOS results as procedural error\ni.e. analyst did not follow the sonication procedure due to chaotic information in test procedure i.e. instruction for sonication activity not arranged in proper order in test data sheet. The instruction note is mentioned after centrifugation, filtration of sample and filling the solution into HPLC vial which is inadequate. Due to the chaotic procedure in test data sheet analyst overlooked the note and skipped the procedure of maintaining the temperature of water bath between 5°C to 10°C during sonication. Thus, the temperature of water bath raised up during sonication and solutions were degraded at higher temperature which resulted OOS results.\nAs a part of impact assessment all test data sheet and STPs were verified and no such similar case observed. The test data sheet was aligned with STPs and instruction are arranged at proper place and STPs are align with each other’s. The action on analyst deemed inappropriate due to true root cause identified as “Procedural gap” in STP due to chaotic information in test data sheet analyst overlook the “note” and the procedure of maintaining the temperature of water bath between 5-10°C during sonication which resulted OOS results.\n\nTorrent had taken the following actions with reference to OOS Investigation:\n•\tAs a part of impact assessment, all test data sheet and STPs were verified and no such similar case observed. The test data sheet was aligned with STPs and instruction are arranged at proper place and STPs are align with each other’s.\n•\tFurther, as a part of procedural enhancement SOP NO.
